# SQL_Challenge

In this assignment I was challenged to create an entity relationship diagram mapping the tables created based on data for a fictitious company. After creating the tables and importing the data in SQL using PGAdmin, I ran several queries to view select portions of the data using joins, composite keys, views, and conditional queries. For each table I had to establish appropriate foreign and primary keys, as well as determine how the tables/fields related to one another.
